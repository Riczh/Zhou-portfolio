[Stock pitch for Salesforce](https://preview.shorthand.com/Ucc2ttpL678s5R6m)

### Introduction and Outline

#### High-Level Introduction
Salesforce has enough revenue to grow for a higher valuation, especially in a promising industry. 

As a reader, I want to invest in this company so that I can get a high return.

story arc is described; call to action is identified. Method and medium are identified.

#### Outline

[Story Arc](WechatIMG3037.jpeg)
My story arc is above. It proves that the audience should buy the stock of Salesforce (call-to-action) for a high return. The X axis shows the time, and the Y axis shows the ratio of stock price compared to 2010. The method is to make comparative analysis, and the medium is the ratio of stock price on my website from a source of Yahoo Finance..

I draw two lines in this picture. The upper one is the line of Salesforce; the lower one is the S&P 500, representing other large companies' stock prices. As we can see here, in the past 20 years, Salesforce's increase in stock price is much higher than the increase of S&P 500. Therefore, compared to the most of the companies in S&P 500, Salesforce is a better target for investment.

Moreover, I draw out a valuation line for Salesforce from some famous financial institutions, such as Yahoo Finance & Capital IQ. With the stock price valuation, we can calculate the future return in 1 or 2 years as I show in the right past.
Short description of how you'll be completing the final project:

Since I only have 1 minute to present, I would like to give you a short introduction and three truths with three figures. First, Valuation. I will show the change of stock price ratio of Salesforce and S&P 500 and compare them. Second, Revenue. I will draw a line of revenue to show the correlation of revenue and stock price, and point out the revenue will go higher. Third, future. I will use the estimation of valuation about Salesforce's stock price to calculate the return of investment (ROI).

And finally, I would make a conclusion for the stock pitch. "Salesforce has enough revenue to grow for a higher valuation, especially in a promising industry."

## Final Dataset
https://github.com/Riczh/Zhou-portfolio/blob/master/Ricardo%20ZHOU_TSWD%20data.xlsx

Comments: The datasets mainly from three sources, the annual report of Salesforece, Yahoo Finance and Capital IQ. 
In this process, I used these data as follows. First of all, I showed the changes in revenue and cost of Salesforce in the past 10 years. It can be found that revenue is increasing rapidly, and the growth rate is faster than cost, which means that the profit is also increasing rapidly. Secondly, in the second graph, I will use 2010 stock prices as a baseline to see the percentage growth of Salesforce and S&P 500. It can be clearly seen that Salesforce's stock price is growing faster than S&P 500. Finally, it shows the future stock price estimate, explaining what the return of buying Salesforce now will be in one year.

## Wireframe & StoryBoard

[Storyboard](WechatIMG3110.jpeg)
My storyboards should be a visual walkthrough of the primary elements of your outline. It can be divided into three parts. Figures 1, 2, and 8 are the introduction to the background content and results, Figures 3 and 4 are the introduction to the revenue part, and 5, 6, and 7 are the introduction to most of the contents. These three parts are a good demonstration of the type of audience and the whole process of persuading the audience to buy stocks and invest.

## User research protocol

Once your interviews are complete, you should have documented findings that detail what you've learned by showing your early wireframes / storyboards to at least three different individuals.  

Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.
