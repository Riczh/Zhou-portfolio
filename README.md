For Telling stories w/ Data

# About me 
You can know everything about me in the course. Since it is a public platform that everyone can view this website, I refuse to share the real identity of myself, even though I know this will make me lose some points. These information includes my name, pronouns, and the program I am in. Due to this ideology, I almost do not use Facebook or Instagram, but I am glad to make connections on Linkedin or WhatsApp. 

Reading between the lines, you can find me is think it scorn to usefless and unreasonable rules, even it is from an authority.
 
# What I hope to learn 
Just as I sincerely expressed in the last course, I would like to know more about using graphs to express my ideas. A surprise of me is that we can learn how to use Github in the process. Look forward to the next course.

## The different methods of visualization and the comparison

The three pictures show different aspects of the same data. For the first picture, it illustrates the general government debt in 2015 for countries. The picture only uses the data in one year, and we highlight the US in the picture to compare with others.

In the second picture, we show the grid data from 1995-2019 for each countries. The trend of the general government debt is comparable with this picture.

In the third picture, we show the aggregated data of general government deba, which can help us to know the trend of the world of government debt. I choose this data because it is likeable and not very shiny.
