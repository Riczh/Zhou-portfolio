For Telling stories w/ Data

# About me 
You can know everything about me in the course. Since it is a public platform that everyone can view this website, I refuse to share the real identity of myself, even though I know this will make me lose some points. These information includes my name, pronouns, and the program I am in. Due to this ideology, I almost do not use Facebook or Instagram, but I am glad to make connections on Linkedin or WhatsApp. 

Reading between the lines, you can find me is think it scorn to usefless and unreasonable rules, even it is from an authority.
 
# What I hope to learn 
Just as I sincerely expressed in the last course, I would like to know more about using graphs to express my ideas. A surprise of me is that we can learn how to use Github in the process. Look forward to the next course.

## The different methods of visualization and the comparison

The three pictures show different aspects of the same data. For the first picture, it illustrates the general government debt in 2015 for countries. The picture only uses the data in one year, and we highlight the US in the picture to compare with others.

In the second picture, we show the grid data from 1995-2019 for each countries. The trend of the general government debt is comparable with this picture.

In the third picture, we show the aggregated data of general government deba, which can help us to know the trend of the world of government debt. I choose this data because it is likeable and not very shiny.

## The link of the Original Picture and Why I select this picture
![Volume Growth in the Apparel from Statista](https://github.com/Riczh/Zhou-portfolio/blob/master/Statista-Outlook-Volume-Growth-in-the-Apparel-market-worldwide.png?raw=true)

I selected this picture because I hope to find a macroeconomic data about a business situation influenced by COVID-19. And I hope this macroeconomic data is from an reliable source (Statista). You can access this data from the CMU Library resources.

## How I create my own picture

I created my own picture by three steps: 1) wireframe a solution, 2) ask for helps from friends, and 3) draw the picture in Excel.

### Wireframe a solution
![My Wireframe](https://github.com/Riczh/Zhou-portfolio/blob/master/WechatIMG3037.jpeg)

After thinking about how to reform it, I made a wireframe for the picture and change three things. First, I changed title of the picture to make the meaning clearer. Second, I distinguished the total growth lines with others to highlight it. Third, I reduced many data labels but only left the extremum.

### Ask for helps from friends

I found two friends who are not very familiar with telling stories with data. But their ideas are insightful. I will call them A & B in the answers of each questions.

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
A: The trend of Apparel growth
B: The influence of COVID-19

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
A: The growth rate of men’s apparel market is higher than the other.
B: The Apparel market is deeply influenced by COVID-19 and it will come back in the further several years.
 	
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
A: I don’t know how to get the number from 2020-2025.
B: I hope you can add colors in the real pictures to make it more readable.

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
A: The businessman of Apparel market?
B: The policymaker dealing with COVID-19?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
A: I will change the year for 2020-2025 to 2020E - 2025E to make it as estimation.
B: I will make the unimportant lines grey and only highlight Total.

### Draw the picture in Excel

After receiving the helps from friends, I began to draw the picture in Excel. 
![My Final Solution](https://github.com/Riczh/Zhou-portfolio/blob/master/Jietu20200721-175556%402x.jpg)

Except for accepting the suggestions from my friends (1. change the year for 2020-2025 to 2020E - 2025E to make it as estimation; 2. make the unimportant lines grey and only highlight Total), I used black as the color of the total line to highlight it. I also changed the title to make it more readable. Finally, I reduced most of the data points and only left two.
