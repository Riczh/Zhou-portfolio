For Telling stories w/ Data

# About me 
You can know everything about me in the course. Since it is a public platform that everyone can view this website, I refuse to share the real identity of myself, even though I know this will make me lose some points. These information includes my name, pronouns, and the program I am in. Due to this ideology, I almost do not use Facebook or Instagram, but I am glad to make connections on Linkedin or WhatsApp. 

Reading between the lines, you can find me is think it scorn to usefless and unreasonable rules, even it is from an authority.
 
# What I hope to learn 
Just as I sincerely expressed in the last course, I would like to know more about using graphs to express my ideas. A surprise of me is that we can learn how to use Github in the process. Look forward to the next course.
